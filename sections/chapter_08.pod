=head0 Style and Efficacy

Quality matters. Programs have bugs. Programs need maintenance and expansion.
Programs have multiple programmers.

To program well, we must find the balance between getting the job done now and
making our lives easier in the future.  We must balance time, resources, and
quality. The craft of programming demands that we do that to the best of our
ability.

To write Perl well, we must understand the language. We must also cultivate a
sense of good taste for the language and the design of programs.  The only way
to do so is to practice maintaining code and reading and writing great code.
This path has no shortcuts, but it does have guideposts.
