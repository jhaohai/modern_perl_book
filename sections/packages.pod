=head1 Packages

Z<packages>
X<packages>
X<namespaces>

A Perl I<namespace> associates and encapsulates various named entities within a
named category. It's like your family name or a brand name. Unlike a real-world
name, a namespace implies no direct relationship between entities. Such
relationships may exist, but they do not have to.

A I<package> in Perl is a collection of code in a single namespace. The
distinction is subtle: the package represents the source code and the namespace
represents the entity created when Perl parses that code.

X<builtins; C<package>>

The C<package> builtin declares a package and a namespace:

=begin programlisting

    package MyCode;

    our @boxes;

    sub add_box { ... }

=end programlisting

X<namespaces; fully qualified>

All global variables and functions declared or referred to after the package
declaration refer to symbols within the C<MyCode> namespace. You can refer to
the C<@boxes> variable from the C<main> namespace only by its I<fully
qualified> name of C<@MyCode::boxes>. A fully qualified name includes a
complete package name, so you can call the C<add_box()> function only by
C<MyCode::add_box()>.

X<scope; packages>

The scope of a package continues until the next C<package> declaration or the
end of the file, whichever comes first. With C<package>, you may provide a
block which explicitly delineates the scope of the declaration:

=begin programlisting

    package Pinball::Wizard
    {
        our $VERSION = 1969;
    }

=end programlisting

The default package is the C<main> package. Without a package declaration, the
current package is C<main>. This rule applies to one-liners, standalone
programs, and even F<.pm> files.

X<packages; versions>
X<C<$VERSION>>

Besides a name, a package has a version and three implicit methods, C<import()>
(L<importing>), C<unimport()>, and C<VERSION()>. C<VERSION()> returns the
package's version number. This number is a series of numbers contained in a
package global named C<$VERSION>. By rough convention, versions are a series of
integers separated by dots, as in C<1.23> or C<1.1.10>.

X<version numbers>

Perl includes a stricter syntax for version numbers, as documented in C<perldoc
version::Internals>. These version numbers must have a leading C<v> character
and at least three integer components separated by periods:

=begin programlisting

    package MyCode v1.2.1;

=end programlisting

Combined with the block form of a C<package> declaration, you can write:

=begin programlisting

    package Pinball::Wizard v1969.3.7 { ... }

=end programlisting

This syntax is still rare, though. You're more likely to see the pre-5.14
version:

=begin programlisting

    package MyCode;

    our $VERSION = 1.21;

=end programlisting

X<C<UNIVERSAL>>
X<C<VERSION()>>

Every package inherits a C<VERSION()> method from the C<UNIVERSAL> base class.
You may override C<VERSION()>, though there are few reasons to do so. This
method returns the value of C<$VERSION>:

=begin programlisting

    my $version = Some::Plugin->VERSION;

=end programlisting

If you provide a version number as an argument, this method will throw an
exception unless the version of the module is equal to or greater than the
argument:

=begin programlisting

    # require at least 2.1
    Some::Plugin->VERSION( 2.1 );

    die "Your plugin $version is too old"
        unless $version > 2;

=end programlisting

=head2 Packages and Namespaces

X<namespaces>
X<packages; namespaces>

Every C<package> declaration creates a new namespace, if necessary, and causes
the parser to put all subsequent package global symbols (global variables and
functions) into that namespace.

X<namespaces; open>

Perl has I<open namespaces>. You can add functions or variables to a namespace
at any point, either with a new package declaration:

=begin programlisting

    package Pack
    {
        sub first_sub { ... }
    }

    Pack::first_sub();

    package Pack
    {
        sub second_sub { ... }
    }

    Pack::second_sub();

=end programlisting

... or by fully qualifying function names at the point of declaration:


=begin programlisting

    # implicit
    package main;

    sub Pack::third_sub { ... }

=end programlisting

You can add to a package at any point during compilation or runtime, regardless
of the current file, though building up a package from multiple separate
declarations (in multiple files!) can make code difficult to spelunk.

X<namespaces; multi-level>

Namespaces can have as many levels as your organizational scheme requires,
though namespaces are not hierarchical. The only relationship between packages
is semantic, not technical. Many projects and businesses create their own
top-level namespaces. This reduces the possibility of global conflicts and
helps to organize code on disk. For example:

=over 4

=item * C<StrangeMonkey> is the project name

=item * C<StrangeMonkey::UI> organizes user interface code

=item * C<StrangeMonkey::Persistence> organizes data management code

=item * C<StrangeMonkey::Test> organizes testing code for the project

=back

... and so on. This is a convention, but it's a useful one.
