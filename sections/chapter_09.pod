=head0 Managing Real Programs

Z<writing_real_programs>

A book can teach you to write small programs to solve example problems. You can
learn a lot of syntax that way.

To write real programs to solve real problems, you must learn to I<manage> code
written in your language. How do you organize code? How do you know that it
works? How can you make it robust in the face of errors? What makes code
concise, clear, and maintainable? Modern Perl helps you answer all of those
questions.
