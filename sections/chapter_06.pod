Much of Perl's text processing power comes from its use of I<regular
expressions>. A regular expression (also I<regex> or I<regexp>) is a I<pattern>
which describes characteristics of a piece of text. A I<regular expression
engine> applies these patterns to match or to replace portions of text.

While mastering regular expressions is a daunting pursuit, a little knowledge
will give you great power. Perl's core regex documentation includes a tutorial
(C<perldoc perlretut>), a reference guide (C<perldoc perlreref>), and full
documentation (C<perldoc perlre>). Jeffrey Friedl's book I<Mastering Regular
Expressions> explains the theory and the mechanics of how regular expressions
work.
